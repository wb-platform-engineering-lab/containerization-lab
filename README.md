# Containerization Lab

A hands-on, phase-by-phase lab for mastering container best practices — from your first `docker build` to production-grade images with multi-platform builds, security scanning, signing, and provenance attestation.

Built around **Nexio** — a fictional real-time event processing SaaS — where each phase is motivated by a real engineering problem the team hit as they grew.

> **New here?** Read [PRINCIPLES.md](./PRINCIPLES.md) first — DevSecOps principles, what to decide before Phase 0, and the architecture decisions that constrain every phase. Then read [STORY.md](./STORY.md) for the narrative behind Nexio.

## The Product — Nexio

Nexio is a B2B real-time event processing API. E-commerce companies send behavioural events (page views, cart updates, checkout starts) and receive enriched, structured payloads in milliseconds — driving personalisation, fraud detection, and live inventory signals.

Each phase is motivated by a real containerization pain that emerged as Nexio scaled:

| Phase | Engineers | Problem |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | The app only runs on one laptop |
| 1 | 3 | Images are 1 GB — CI pipeline takes 18 minutes |
| 2 | 5 | Running the full stack locally takes 6 manual commands |
| 3 | 10 | Security scan flagged 47 CVEs in the base image |
| 4 | 15 | BuildKit cache isn't shared — every build re-downloads dependencies |
| 5 | 25 | No one can prove a shipped image hasn't been tampered with |
| 6 | 40 | Images pile up in the registry — $300/month in storage |
| 6b | 40 | Enterprise customer requires on-prem image storage with data residency |
| 7 | 60 | Pentest report: containers run as root with full Linux capabilities |
| 8 | 80 | Local dev drifts from production — bugs only appear in CI |
| 9 | 100+ | Config is baked into images — can't promote the same artifact across envs |
| 10 | — | Full production pipeline: build → scan → sign → push → provenance |

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine on Linux) installed and running
- Basic terminal / shell familiarity
- No prior Docker knowledge required for Phase 0

---

## How to use this lab

Each phase lives in its own directory with a self-contained `README.md` that includes:
- A short narrative putting the problem in context
- Concept explanations
- A step-by-step hands-on walkthrough
- A command reference
- A "what this doesn't do yet" section linking forward to the next phase
- Troubleshooting tips

Start at Phase 0 and work forward. Each phase builds directly on the previous one.
